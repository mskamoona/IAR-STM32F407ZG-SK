Test


This manual describes the demonstration software running on the IAR 
STM32F407zg-SK, which you can use to evaluate the capabilities of the microcontroller
and the on-board peripherals.

  
Demonstration Package contents
===============================

The demonstration software package contains the following subfolders:

- Test folder:
The Test folder contains STM32F407ZG-SK peripheral tests that make up the core 
of the demonstration. These tests demonstrate some capabilities of the 
microcontroller.
  
- library folder
The STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Driver folder contains all the subdirectories and files that make 
up the core of the STM32F4xxx Firmware library:
  - inc subfolder contains the firmware library header files
  - src subfolder contains the firmware library source files
  
- project folder
project folder contains project for the EWARM toolchain (V6.20) that 
compiles all the demonstration files.

Demonstration description 
==========================

1. After power ON(*), there would be the "STM32F407ZG-SK" message and IAR and ST logos 
displayed on LCD.

2. After few seconds, The main Menu is displayed. You can switch between
General purpose peripheral tests or Communication peripheral tests using
Joystick key (J).

The selected item's color is blue. you can use Joystick key (J) to navigate on different 
menu and sub-menu items.

3. If you choose Gen. purpose Periph (pressing Joystick key (J)), you will enter
periph test sub-menu in which you can test STM32F407ZG IAR SK components:

        
    - Accelerometer     : Displaying the board position regardless of horizontal.
    
    - Potentiometer     : Changing the GLCD contrast by moving the potentiometer AN-TR.
    
    - Buzzer            : Generating Beep signal on the buzzer  .
    
    - Audio In/Out      : Play sounds through th headphone.
    
The continue... sub menu allows you to test remaining peripherals due to the 
GLCD line numbers limit. Choosing the Continue... allows you testing:
    
    - LED               : Turning on Leds (STAT1..STAT4) and switch off Leds one by one.
    
    - Temperature Sensor: Using I2C temperature sensor to show temperature. 
    
    - Key Button        : Pressing Tamper Button allow display of "Tamper key pressed"  
                          message display and LED (STAT1) is ON.      
    
3. If you choose Communication Periph (pressing Joystick key (J)), you can test:
    
    - RS232_1          : Using the USART1 to communicate with the hyperterminal with interactive
                        messages on LCD.  
    
    - CAN loopback            : Performing a communication and data transfert between CAN1 an CAN2.  
                     
NOTE: 

* Refer to IAR documentations on Power Supply ways.
** After running tests you can press User key to exit, this allows you to return
to Periph tests sub menu.
*** Choosing Return allows go back to main Menu  
****  The LCD and the Trace module have shared pins (LCD_RST and TRACED2).
If you need to use the LCD and the Trace simultaneously please set 
the Trace port width to 2 in the ETM settings. 

How to use it
============= 
 - Open project at IAR-STM32F407ZG-SK\TEST\TEST.eww  
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
